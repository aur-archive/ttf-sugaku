The ZIP file has all of the type 1 files. I thank Petra Heidorn and Sara Caples
for the early truetype conversions. Preliminary note: nearly all fonts have a
full set of 256 glyphs. Most commercial dingbat fonts have between 25 and 50
glyphs, so the number of glyphs per font is five to ten ten times the norm.
This explains some of the large font sizes. I just don't want to split the files
into ten small pieces each. So, my 100 or so free fonts are equivalent to about
500 to 1000 commercial fonts in terms of quantity of glyphs.

Oh, one last thing: show the fonts, trade them, eat them, color them, abuse
them, put them on web sites, whatever. But no commercial use, please (that is,
no use in products that are sold, and no use on web sites where profits are made
either directly or indirectly). Enjoy.
